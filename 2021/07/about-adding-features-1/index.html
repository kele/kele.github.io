<p>One of the most clever C tricks I&rsquo;ve ever seen is the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#ff79c6">#define BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO(e) (sizeof(struct { int:-!!(e); }))
</span></code></pre></div><p>The
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/6f0d349d922ba44e4348a17a78ea51b7135965b1/tools/include/linux/bug.h#L9macro"><code>BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO(e)</code></a>
macro evaluates whether the compile-time value of <code>e</code> is non-zero (yes, the
name is misleading). If yes, it results in a compiler error, therefore breaking
the build. This trick leverages a few obscure properties of C, one of them
being lack of support for bitfields of a negative width (who would&rsquo;ve
thought?).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we got static assertions in C.</p>
<p>Whoever wrote this line for the first time must have felt a tremendous sense of
accomplishment. This must have come at a cost of losing some sanity, though.</p>
<p>Were <code>sizeof</code> and bitfields designed to support this use case? Unlikely, but
here we are!</p>
<p><strong>This article will be published in a few parts (1 (this), &hellip;)</strong></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although I&rsquo;m mostly talking about (programming) languages, most of
the considerations here also apply (perhaps even better) to libraries, modules,
frameworks, and other software building blocks.</p>
<p>Software engineers always need to choose a tool for the job. Be it a
programming language, a library or an RPC<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> service they wish to delegate
tasks to.  These tools can be pliable and extensible, or - in contrast - rigid
and opinionated.</p>
<p>In his famous 1998 talk - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0">&ldquo;Growing a
Language&rdquo;</a> - Guy L. Steele Jr.
demonstrated (in a very entertaining way) how a language can grow if it has
built-in the ways to do so. The protocol he described is simple, elegant, and
capable. A language like that is very flexible.</p>
<p>When a tool we use doesn&rsquo;t provide the flexibility we <strong>want</strong> (often don&rsquo;t
really need), we find a way to do what we had set our mind on anyway. This
often results in clever<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and hacky solutions. A question that
comes to mind then is: <strong>Why didn&rsquo;t the authors implement this feature in the
first place?</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-we-got-things-done">How We Got Things Done</h2>
<h3 id="sfinae-substitution-failure-is-not-an-error">SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)</h3>
<p>A well-known folk theorem states that C++ templates are Turing complete. People
have used
<a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/templates#templates-vs-overloading">SFINAE</a> for
the craziest things, some of them making their way into the standard library.
No seasoned C++ engineer squints their eyes when they see:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="color:#ff79c6">template</span><span style="color:#ff79c6">&lt;</span><span style="color:#ff79c6">class</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">T</span> <span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span> std<span style="color:#ff79c6">::</span>enable_if<span style="color:#ff79c6">&lt;</span>...<span style="color:#ff79c6">::</span>value<span style="color:#ff79c6">&gt;::</span>type<span style="color:#ff79c6">&gt;</span>
<span style="color:#8be9fd">void</span> foo() { ... }
</code></pre></div><p>a declaration that, to someone unfamiliar with this madness, would read as:
<em>&ldquo;foo is a generic function with a type parameter T, which is equal to&hellip; WHAT
IS HAPPENING HERE?!&quot;</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/unexpected-unintended-1-sfinae.jpg" alt="this i sfinae"></p>
<p>SFINAE gave C++ engineers great power. They could now optimize their function
calls based on what the passed object offers, with zero runtime cost. All the
work is done by the compiler and the poor soul who had to write the templates.
Good luck with debugging, too.</p>
<h3 id="enforcing-string-literal-arguments">Enforcing String Literal Arguments</h3>
<p>There are some reasons for enforcing that a given function argument is a string
<strong>literal</strong> (not just any <code>string</code>). One could probably write a linter to
achieve such a thing (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/google/error-prone">ErrorProne</a> in
Java), but in Go, this can be done using this trick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#ff79c6">package</span> fooer

<span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">type</span> compileTimeString <span style="color:#8be9fd">string</span>

<span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">Foo</span>(s compileTimeString) {
	fmt.<span style="color:#50fa7b">Printf</span>(<span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#34;%s&#34;</span>, s)
}
</code></pre></div><p><code>compileTimeString</code> is an unexported type of package <code>fooer</code>, therefore one
cannot create a <strong>variable</strong> of this type. But, in Go, you can use a string
literal to create an <strong>untyped</strong> string. Therefore, in the expression
<code>Foo(&quot;bar&quot;)</code>, the argument is actually an untyped string and it is coerced to
<code>compileTimeString</code>.</p>
<p>In the case of Go, this feels like an obscure property of a language that
otherwise embraces simplicity and clarity.</p>
<h2 id="what-has-just-happened">What Has Just Happened?</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take another look at the problems we&rsquo;ve tried to solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>static assertion on a compile-time expression,</li>
<li>ensuring basic properties of a type we&rsquo;re writing a function for (e.g. it has
a given method),</li>
<li>expecting compile-time literal values as opposed to dynamic (possibly
user-controlled) ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see: <strong>none of the presented solutions are easy to read</strong>. If you
haven&rsquo;t seen any of these before, I expect you to scratch your head <strong>a lot</strong>
and still run out of patience before getting it. <strong>The problem isn&rsquo;t you.</strong></p>
<p>A deceivingly simple way to stop this <em>madness</em> would be to extend the language
itself to support such use cases. But, there are many reasons why languages
don&rsquo;t add first-class support for some features.</p>
<h2 id="why-cant-my-language-just-support-x">Why Can&rsquo;t My Language Just Support X?</h2>
<p>Firstly, we need to consider whether we want a rich feature set to begin with,
regardless of the implementation cost.</p>
<p>Then, we should consider what it takes to have an implementation of a language
(library) with many features.</p>
<p>Lastly, what the cost of adopting new features in a language (library) that
already exists (and has many, many users) is.</p>
<h3 id="do-we-really-want-lots-of-features">Do We Really Want Lots of Features?</h3>
<h4 id="the-ramp-up-cost">The Ramp-Up Cost</h4>
<p>The bigger<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> the language is, the higher the ramp-up cost. In your
project, this might be negligible if new contributors are rare. Nonetheless, it
is also a high barrier to entry for folks who are trying to <strong>learn</strong> new
technology in their spare time.</p>
<p>Sometimes the high ramp-up cost is worth the productivity benefits one gains
when familiar with the tool. For example, Rust&rsquo;s borrow checking seems hard to
learn at first but eliminates whole classes of bug that C programmers have
been struggling with for decades.</p>
<h4 id="theres-more-than-one-way">There&rsquo;s More Than One Way</h4>
<p>Quite often an unintended consequence of adding a feature is opening the
avenues of doing things in more than one way. At first glance (at second,
probably, too), this shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. What&rsquo;s wrong with having options,
right?</p>
<h5 id="subtle-differences">Subtle Differences</h5>
<p>One of the problems lies in the fact that <strong>the differences between approaches
are often subtle</strong>, but vital in some scenarios. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>pre-incrementation and post-incrementation (<code>++x </code>and <code>x++</code>),</li>
<li>the multitude of ways one can
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initialization">initialize</a> an
object in C++,</li>
<li>equality checks in
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness">JavaScript</a>
or <a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=492">PHP</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because these solutions actually differ in some scenarios, their pros and cons
need to be considered. These (opinionated) analyses make their way into coding
style guides, tutorials, and blog posts. One needs to now learn what the
preferred approach is,the approach  that should be used in obscure cases, and
which approaches should be avoided at all costs; even though they look all
equally good at solving the problem at hand.</p>
<h5 id="consistency">Consistency</h5>
<p>One more benefit of having exactly one way to solve a problem is
<strong>consistency</strong>. Working with a unified codebase makes things easier for
developers switching between projects, as their ramp-up doesn&rsquo;t involve getting
used to a new way of doing things. Static analysis (more on that later) tooling
becomes simpler as there are fewer cases to support. Enough consistency can
also enable <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/ch22.html">Large-Scale
Changes</a>.</p>
<h4 id="context-heavy-code">Context Heavy Code</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the following snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">store(db, x)
</code></pre></div><p>What does this code do? Well, it depends whether the language:</p>
<ul>
<li>supports implicit conversions to mutable references (e.g. <code>void store(DB &amp;db, Val &amp;x)</code> in C++, as opposed to a <code>store(&amp;mut db, x)</code> call in Rust) &ndash; this
might allow both <code>db</code> and <code>x</code> to be modified by <code>store(),</code></li>
<li>supports implicit user-defined conversions (e.g. what if <code>x</code> is not the right
type, but could be implicitly converted to a type that matches the signature of
<code>store()</code>?),</li>
<li>features borrowing (e.g. like
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html">Rust</a>),</li>
<li>supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Non-strict_evaluation">non-strict
evaluation</a>,</li>
<li>and many other things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of the above features expand the ocean of possibilities of what this single
line of code can do. This burdens the reader with keeping in their mind lots of
context; increasing the overall cognitive load needed to understand the
program. This is especially taxing when the technology stack of your project
isn&rsquo;t uniform and you need to consciously keep track of which set of patterns you
should recognize at a given time.</p>
<h4 id="idioms">Idioms</h4>
<p>Engineers strive to write <strong>idiomatic code</strong>. We tend to like patterns, as they
let us understand things at a glance (if we&rsquo;re familiar with them). For
example, to create a list of integer squares, one would write in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">z <span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span> [ i<span style="color:#ff79c6">*</span>i <span style="color:#ff79c6">for</span> i <span style="color:#ff79c6">in</span> <span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">range</span>(<span style="color:#bd93f9">0</span>, <span style="color:#bd93f9">10</span>) ]
</code></pre></div><p>which uses a construct called <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0202/">list
comprehensions</a>.</p>
<p>In Go, which doesn&rsquo;t feature list comprehensions, one writes simply:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">var</span> z <span style="color:#8be9fd">int</span>
<span style="color:#ff79c6">for</span> i <span style="color:#ff79c6">:=</span> <span style="color:#bd93f9">0</span>; i &lt; <span style="color:#bd93f9">10</span>; i<span style="color:#ff79c6">++</span> {
	z = <span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">append</span>(z, i<span style="color:#ff79c6">*</span>i)
}
</code></pre></div><p>and <strong>both code snippets are idiomatic in their respective languages</strong>. It
would not have surprised me if you got a code review comment requesting a
change if you used a <code>for</code> loop in Python for this task, but in Go, there is
simply no alternative.</p>
<p>Sometimes, adding a feature completely changes the feel of a language.</p>
<h4 id="making-things-error-prone">Making Things Error-Prone</h4>
<p>In C (and other languages<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>), one can use assignment as an expression
(e.g. in an <code>if</code> condition). Code like this is fairly common:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#ff79c6">while</span> ((c <span style="color:#ff79c6">=</span> getchar()) <span style="color:#ff79c6">!=</span> EOF) {
	<span style="color:#6272a4">// ...
</span><span style="color:#6272a4"></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>This, unfortunately, makes many other seemingly innocent programs error-prone.
Consider this snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#ff79c6">while</span> (x <span style="color:#ff79c6">==</span> y) {
	<span style="color:#6272a4">// ...
</span><span style="color:#6272a4"></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Now, one can easily make a typo or overlook a missing <code>=</code> sign during a code
review. That would be a bug, resulting in mutating <code>x</code> (and the check likely
passing too).</p>
<h4 id="gotcha">Gotcha!</h4>
<p>Some features are just plain weird and complicated. There are usually <em>some</em>
reasons behind introducing them, but they are scary nevertheless. It seems to
be a good idea to make them obvious (like Rust does when you use <code>unsafe</code>), but
this often doesn&rsquo;t happen. Consider the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#6272a4">// Definitions of the Bar interface and BarImpl struct are omitted.
</span><span style="color:#6272a4"></span>
<span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">Foo</span>() Bar {
	<span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">var</span> bar <span style="color:#ff79c6">*</span>BarImpl
	<span style="color:#ff79c6">if</span> (bar <span style="color:#ff79c6">==</span> <span style="color:#ff79c6">nil</span>) {
    		fmt.<span style="color:#50fa7b">Println</span>(<span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#34;Abra&#34;</span>)
	}
	<span style="color:#ff79c6">return</span> bar
}

<span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">main</span>() {
	<span style="color:#ff79c6">if</span> (<span style="color:#50fa7b">Foo</span>() <span style="color:#ff79c6">==</span> <span style="color:#ff79c6">nil</span>) {
    		fmt.<span style="color:#50fa7b">Println</span>(<span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#34;Kadabra&#34;</span>)
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>The code above compiles without any warnings or errors. Can you guess what it
prints<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">Abra
</code></pre></div><p>If you are not familiar with Go, this might be a surprise to you.  This is
because, in Go, a <code>nil</code> pointer to a concrete type is not the same as a <code>nil</code>
interface value<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>]. This is a feature that is sometimes
convenient<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, but utterly confusing to new Gophers.</p>
<h4 id="undefined-behavior">Undefined Behavior</h4>
<p>One infamous <em>feature</em> of languages like C or C++ is the so-called
<em><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub">undefined or unspecified
behavior</a></em>. For example, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/eval_order">the
order of evaluation of function call
arguments</a> is an
unspecified behavior in C++. This can lead to surprising errors like a memory
leak described <a href="https://dustri.org/b/my-favourite-c-footgun.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Not defining the precise behavior of a given language construct is not done out
of laziness. It gives the compiler enough freedom to perform plenty of
optimizations. These can even be platform-specific, making it possible to
create efficient ports of software.</p>
<p>The question remains: how much flexibility is too much?</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-cost-of-implementing-a-feature">What Is the Cost of Implementing a Feature?</h2>
<p>At some point, we are convinced that a new feature belongs to a language
(library). It fits well and improves the ergonomics. For it to be useful, it
needs to be implemented. In the cases where this is possible (not always), it
might take a long time to do it right. Even then, we might have inadvertently
changed how it feels to use the language (library) as a whole.</p>
<p>In the next post, we&rsquo;ll talk more about the (lasting) costs of adding a feature
to your language (library).</p>
