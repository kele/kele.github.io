    </header><p><em>This is the second part of the &ldquo;About Adding Features&rdquo; series of posts.  The
first post is <a href="https://kele.codes/2021/07/about-adding-features-1/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>At some point, we are convinced that a new feature belongs to a library. It
fits well, improves the ergonomics, and on top of that - doesn&rsquo;t seem like that
much work. The costs that immediately come to mind are the engineering time
needed to implement the feature and the long-term maintenance burden. This is
not the whole picture, though. There are many pitfalls one has to avoid when
extending or changing a public interface.</p>
<h2 id="cognitive-load">Cognitive Load</h2>
<p>Undeniably, the architecture of a library has the most significant impact on
the user&rsquo;s experience. It affects the organization of the public interface, how
it needs to be used, and - perhaps most importantly - how programmers need to
think about the problem they are trying to solve.</p>
<p>Explaining how to choose a suitable mental model is well beyond the scope of
this post (and I don&rsquo;t really have an unconquerable answer). Assuming it has
been picked - we should strive to keep it as simple as possible. Even if we
break DRY<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> here and there.</p>
<h2 id="complexity-and-quantity">Complexity and Quantity</h2>
<p>Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or 1 horse-sized duck?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> It&rsquo;s a
silly question, but an interesting one. It shows that it is not obvious to us
how problems scale, neither with size nor quantity.</p>
<p>We can change the theme to coding and ask an analogous question: would you
rather use 100 small interfaces or 1 big one? In many cases, the number 100
would be an exaggeration. One rarely has to deal with  100 interfaces to solve
a problem. It is also not the case that - with the big interface - one has to
deal with the whole thing at once. As usual, it seems that the answer is both
&ldquo;it depends&rdquo; and &ldquo;somewhere in between&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To stay pragmatic, though, we can follow the rule of thumb: <strong>do what reduces
complexity, or increases it the least.</strong> But how to apply it in practice? Take
Go&rsquo;s standard library package <code>strings</code> as an example - it offers many
functions for inspecting or manipulating text. Amongst other functions, it
includes:</p>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="specialize-or-parametrize">Specialize or Parametrize?</h3>
<p>To make the package smaller, one could instead come up with<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">Contains</span>(s <span style="color:#8be9fd">string</span>, r Rule) <span style="color:#8be9fd">bool</span>

<span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">Substring</span>(s <span style="color:#8be9fd">string</span>) Rule
<span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">CharSet</span>(set <span style="color:#8be9fd">string</span>) Rule
<span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">Func</span>(f <span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func</span>(<span style="color:#8be9fd">rune</span>) <span style="color:#8be9fd">bool</span>) Rule
<span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">FromLeft</span>(r Rule) Rule
<span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">FromRight</span>(r Rule) Rule
</code></pre></div><p>Now, we replace:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ContainsAny(s, substr)</code> with <code>Contains(s, CharSet(substr))</code>,</li>
<li><code>TrimLeft(s, cs)</code> with <code>Trim(s, FromLeft(CharSet(cs))</code>,</li>
<li><code>TrimPrefix(s, prefix)</code> with <code>Trim(s, FromLeft(Substring(prefix))</code>,</li>
<li>and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, we have managed to cut the number of different functions almost
in half (13 vs. 7). Is it really an improvement, though? We have increased the
complexity of the mental model by introducing a new concept - a <code>Rule</code>. Now,
every developer needs to understand what a <code>Rule</code> is within the <code>strings</code>
package, and how it&rsquo;s used. We also added <code>Rule</code> transformations, namely
<code>FromLeft</code> and <code>FromRight</code>, in order to support <code>TrimLeft</code> and <code>TrimRight</code>
(along with their <code>Func</code> variants).</p>
<h3 id="yagni">YAGNI</h3>
<p>One could argue that introducing the <code>Rule</code> interface opens up more
possibilities. We can now trim log statements (e.g. <strong><code>&quot;13-03-2021 15:35:21 foo/bar/baz.go:123:</code></strong><code> error during frombulating&quot;</code>) by creating a new <code>Rule</code>
that matches the timestamp and code path prefix. This saves us the cost of
reimplementing the <code>Trim</code> part of the function ourselves!</p>
<p>In such cases, it is worth it to consider the YAGNI<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> (You aren&rsquo;t gonna
need it) principle. If not taken to extremes (pun intended), it can be
beneficial to determine whether additional complexity is warranted. Consider
also what would be the cost of adding the thing you wanted now in the future.
Would it be roughly the same as if you did it now? If yes, then postpone it.</p>
<p>There is usually little harm in adding an extra convenience method, e.g. adding
<code>Contains</code>, even if <code>Find</code> could be used instead. It is still important to not
introduce inconsistencies - e.g. if <code>Find</code> works with empty strings, <code>Contains</code>
should too.</p>
<p>But what if we actually <strong>need</strong> to trim the log statements?</p>
<h3 id="utility-packages">Utility Packages</h3>
<p>In such a case, consider creating a utility package that works <strong>with</strong> the
interface instead of extending it. For the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s assume that
<code>Trim</code> is heavily optimized under the hood - and we <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> want to
reimplement it. We can implement the prefix matching logic and then simply use
<code>TrimPrefix</code> to cut it out.</p>
<p>What if it turns out that this is not the only complex trimming operation that
is commonly needed? Well, we can come up with a <code>trimutil</code> package that
implements <code>TrimPrefix(s string, m Match)</code>. Whoever needs the complexity of
matching the string according to its format will easily understand what&rsquo;s going
on. Who doesn&rsquo;t - won&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<h3 id="not-enough-pieces">Not Enough Pieces</h3>
<p>It is not always the case that we can build things <strong>on top of</strong> a package.
Many libraries contain enough functionality to make it difficult to accommodate
the wishes of all its potential users. Take the example of the Go HTTP library
that provides a simple file server:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">func</span> <span style="color:#50fa7b">FileServer</span>(root FileSystem) Handler
</code></pre></div><p>It&rsquo;s a fantastically simple interface that gets the job done. Under the hood,
it handles the intricacies of the HTTP protocol, range requests, redirects,
<code>If-Modified-Since</code> headers and so on. But what if we&rsquo;d like to use it to serve
our web application? It&rsquo;s all well until the user asks for a non-existing file.
They&rsquo;ll be greeted with a rather ascetic <code>&quot;404 Not Found&quot;</code> plaintext message.
This is a very different user experience from any well-polished service, where
the error site has pretty graphics and offers ways to help the user reach where
they need to be.</p>
<p>Is there a way to configure the <code>FileServer</code>s error responses? No. Is there a
way to build on top of it, keeping all the much-needed functionality that hides
underneath? Yes, but it&rsquo;d be pretty complicated<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="consider-the-problem">Consider the Problem</h3>
<p>The library authors could&rsquo;ve done the following instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>create a new <code>FileServer</code> type with configurable error responses; or</li>
<li>add a parameter to the <code>FileServer</code> call that allows for providing its own
error responses.</li>
</ol>
<p>The options above are by no means an exhaustive list. Both would extend the
<code>http</code> package (which is already pretty big by Go standards) and add some
complexity to the implementation. If there was ever a discussion about doing
this, they have decided against it.</p>
<p>One good argument supporting such a decision starts with a thought experiment:
**who are the users of this API? **It is clear that this was meant to be a
simple file server. There is no support for compression, generating index pages
, and so on (like e.g. fasthttp
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/valyala/fasthttp?utm_source=godoc#FS">does</a>).
You could safely say that <strong>it is not meant for advanced users - and that&rsquo;s
ok!</strong></p>
<p>Always ask yourself who the users are and what problem they are trying to
tackle. Look at it holistically - quite often, it will turn out that providing
just one feature is still not enough to solve the task at hand. It can also
lead you to a completely different path - and that&rsquo;s ok too.</p>
