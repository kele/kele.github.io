      <description>This is the second part of the &amp;ldquo;About Adding Features&amp;rdquo; series of posts. The first post is here.
At some point, we are convinced that a new feature belongs to a library. It fits well, improves the ergonomics, and on top of that - doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like that much work. The costs that immediately come to mind are the engineering time needed to implement the feature and the long-term maintenance burden.</description>

      <description>Teaser One of the most clever C tricks I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen is the following:
#define BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO(e) (sizeof(struct { int:-!!(e); })) The BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO(e) macro evaluates whether the compile-time value of e is non-zero (yes, the name is misleading). If yes, it results in a compiler error, therefore breaking the build. This trick leverages a few obscure properties of C, one of them being lack of support for bitfields of a negative width (who would&amp;rsquo;ve thought?</description>
