    <h1 id="what-this-is-all-about">What this is all about</h1>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I'm constantly distracting myself. Very often I visit sites like Hacker News or
lobste.rs even though I don't have time to read the articles. As one can
imagine, it doesn't help very much with being productive. I don't really have
this problem when I'm busy and focused, but when I have 2-3 minutes to spare
(because the project is building, my map-reduce is running or I'm waiting for a
reply), my habit is to skim through every website that I find at least mildly
interesting.</p>
<p>I've tried different Chrome extensions, changes in <code>/etc/hosts</code> or blocking some
domains on my home router, but none of these were flexible enough for me so I
ended up working around them. This is where the idea of writing my own proxy
server came from. The list of features should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>redirecting,</li>
<li>time based blocking,</li>
<li>delaying (if a site loads slowly, I tend to realize that I shouldn't be doing
this),</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-rust">Why Rust?</h2>
<p>The language I used the most was always C++. At work I'm using mostly Go now.
Although, the idea of having a strong compiler definitely speaks to me. That's
why I wanted to learn Rust. Also, a proxy server seems to be a project easy
enough that it won't distract me too much from learning the language itself, but
hard enough to see whether I like Rust or not.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-you-expect">What can you expect?</h2>
<p>This is going to be a journal of my adventure with Rust. I have never ever used
this language, so it's not going to be a tutorial of <strong>how to write good Rust</strong>,
but I'm definitely going to try my best to learn as much as possible and share
the knowledge. I have an idea what the borrow checking is about and I have some
experience with rich type systems (Hindley-Milner from OCaml), so I hope I won't
be lost completely. :)</p>
<h1 id="preparations">Preparations</h1>
<h2 id="compiler">Compiler</h2>
<p>Instalation is very simple: <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup.rs</a>. Some of the Linux
distros are going to have Rust in their repositories already.</p>
<p>For convenience, most of the operations (creating projects, building, running)
are done by using a tool called <code>cargo</code>&rsquo;. Please, do not forget to install it if
you're not using rustup.rs.</p>
<h2 id="documentation-and-other-learning-resources">Documentation and other learning resources</h2>
<p>There are lots of good materials for learning Rust. The primary official
document of the language and the standard library documentation can be both
found at <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust-lang.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="my-programming-environment">My programming environment</h2>
<p>VIM + <a href="https://github.com/phildawes/racer">Racer</a> +
<a href="https://github.com/racer-rust/vim-racer">vim-racer</a>. Racer is an
auto-completion tool for Rust.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-project">Creating a new project</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">cargo new --bin project
</code></pre></div><p>This command creates a template of an executable  (<code>--bin</code>) named <code>project</code>.
What's interestinghere is that the project is going to be created under Git
versioning control system by default (nice gesture ;)).</p>
<p><code>cargo build</code> builds the project. The default template is the well known <strong>Hello
World</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="the-end-of-the-first-post">The end of the first post</h1>
<p>It's all for today. In the next post there will be some code, I promise! :)</p>
